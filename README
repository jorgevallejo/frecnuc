# Contents
*frecnuc.sh* - bash script (mostly AWK).

*good_sequence.fa* - short genomic sequence in FASTA format.

*bad_sequence.fa* - invalid genomic sequence with an _x_ letter
in between the nucleotide sequence. It should trigger the error message.

# Instructions

Local:
$ ./frecnuc.sh file

Or put it in your bin directory:
$ frecnuc file

It only accepts one file as input, further files will be ignored.

The file must contain ONLY one sequence.

It does not check if the format is correct.


# Future development

## More than one sequence in the same file.

## Expand for RNA and aminoacid sequences

## Check if the sequences are in FASTA format
